```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Copy Workflow File

Choose the workflow that best fits your needs and copy it to your repository:

```bash
# Create workflows directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy the basic workflow (recommended for most users)
cp examples/basic-workflow.yml .github/workflows/kiro-badges.yml
```

### 2. Customize Configuration

Edit the workflow file to match your requirements:

- **Trigger conditions**: Modify `on:` section for when the action should run
- **Permissions**: Ensure `contents: write` is included
- **Commit messages**: Customize the commit message for badge updates
- **Branch restrictions**: Limit to specific branches if needed

### 3. Set Up Repository

Ensure your repository has the correct structure:

```
your-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/kiro-badges.yml  # Your workflow file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .kiro/specs/                       # Kiro specifications
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-1/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md                   # Task file for feature 1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-2/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md                   # Task file for feature 2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                          # Your project documentation
```

### 4. Add Badges to Documentation

Use the examples in [badge-examples.md](badge-examples.md) to add badges to your README:

```markdown
# My Project

![All Kiro Tasks](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/.kiro/badge-data-all.json&query=$.message&label=All%20Tasks)

## Features

- ![Feature 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/.kiro/feature-1-badge-data.json&query=$.message&label=Feature%201) Authentication system
- ![Feature 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/.kiro/feature-2-badge-data.json&query=$.message&label=Feature%202) API integration
```

## Common Customizations

### Trigger Conditions

**Only on main branch**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '.kiro/specs/**/tasks.md'
    branches: [main]
```

**Include pull requests**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '.kiro/specs/**/tasks.md'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '.kiro/specs/**/tasks.md'
```

**Scheduled updates**:
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Daily at 6 AM UTC
```

### Custom Commit Messages

```yaml
- name: Generate Kiro task badges
  uses: CLBray/kiro-github-badges@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    commit-message: "üè∑Ô∏è Update task completion badges [skip ci]"
```

### Debug Mode

```yaml
- name: Generate Kiro task badges
  uses: CLBray/kiro-github-badges@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  env:
    ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Verify Workflow Syntax

Use GitHub's workflow validator or run locally:

```bash
# Install act for local testing (optional)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Test workflow locally
act -n  # Dry run to check syntax
```

### 2. Check File Paths

Ensure your task files are in the correct location:

```bash
find .kiro/specs -name "tasks.md" -type f
```

### 3. Validate Task File Format

Check that your task files use correct checkbox syntax:

```markdown
# ‚úÖ Correct format
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Completed task
- [X] Also completed (uppercase)

# ‚ùå Incorrect format
* [x] Wrong bullet type
- [] Missing space
- [y] Wrong completion marker
```

### 4. Test Badge URLs

Before adding badges to documentation, test the raw JSON URLs:

```bash
# Replace with your actual repository details
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/.kiro/badge-data-all.json"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "label": "All Kiro Tasks",
  "message": "5/10",
  "color": "yellow"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Action doesn't trigger**: Check file paths in trigger conditions
2. **Permission denied**: Ensure `contents: write` permission is set
3. **Badge shows "invalid"**: Verify JSON file exists and is accessible
4. **Tasks not counted correctly**: Check task file markdown syntax
